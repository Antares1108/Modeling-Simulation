# Modeling-Simulation

  •	Built an airport simulation (in Java) which ordered taking off and landing event to minimize waiting time. Allowed users to set specific starting conditions, such as weather and number of runways, on GUI and returned a detailed report

  •	Implemented a traffic simulation (in Java) for a block. Provided GUI interface (JavaFX) to illustrate the traffic flow animation with real life variables (weather, speed) set by users
